## 🚀 Running with Slidev

Run it with [Slidev](https://sli.dev/).

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) ≥ 20
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) is recommended. You can also use `npm` or `yarn`.

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 2. Start the dev server
pnpm dev

# 3. Open the URL printed in the terminal (default: http://localhost:3030)
```

The slides will auto-reload as you edit [`slides.md`](./slides.md).

### Available Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `pnpm install` | Install dependencies (run this first after cloning) |
| `pnpm dev` | Start the dev server at [localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030) |
| `pnpm export` | Export the presentation as PDF |

### Presenter Mode

Open [http://localhost:3030/presenter](http://localhost:3030/presenter) during the dev session for speaker notes, a timer, and slide controls.

### Sharing with the Audience

To let others on the same Wi-Fi follow along live:

```bash
pnpm slidev --remote
```

The terminal will print a network URL like `http://192.168.x.x:3030/` that anyone on the same network can open.
